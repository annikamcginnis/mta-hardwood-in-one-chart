        <p>Tropical forests harbor half of the world’s biodiversity and absorb enormous amounts of carbon, which helps slow climate change, but could disappear in the next 100 years. Well-known culprits include buyers of high-end wood products like furniture and yachts. Lesser known, however, is the role of public infrastructure projects in the supply chains of these felled tropical trees. </p>
        <p>For much of the last century, the New York City Metropolitan Transit Authority has built NYC Subway tracks with imported wood from tropical rainforests around the world. This, despite the state’s passage of a <a href="https://casetext.com/statute/consolidated-laws-of-new-york/chapter-state-finance/article-11-state-purchasing/section-165-effective-until-3212025-purchasing-restrictions" target="blank">state finance law</a> in 1993 that banned purchase of some tropical hardwoods - except if there is no acceptable alternative or it would significantly increase the state’s costs.</p>

        <p>In 2009, the MTA <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2009/a10503?" target="blank">began</a> researching alternative tie materials to timber such as recycled plastic lumber. And after Hurricane Sandy flooded the Staten Island Railway, the MTA <a href="https://www.silive.com/news/2016/04/mta_spiffs_up_staten_island_ra.html" target="blank">reconstructed</a> parts of the railroad with these sustainable plastic ties. </p>
        <p>But this is still the exception, rather than the norm. Data from the MTA acquired through a Freedom of Information Law request shows that between 2014-2024, the authority made 142 purchases of tropical hardwood for rail blocks and ties, costing a total of $14.7 million. </p>
        <p>Some of these acquisitions have been tied to crimes. In <a href="https://citylimits.org/2002/06/03/knocking-on-wood/" target="blank">2002</a>, ‘ekki’ wood bought by the MTA was linked to deforestation in Liberia and illegal arms trafficking. Although the MTA no longer imports from Liberia, it still relies on this species of wood, importing largely from Cameroon. Other popular species used by New York City agencies are ipê and cumaru from Brazil, according to Tim Keating, cofounder of Rainforest Relief, a Brooklyn-based nonprofit. </p>
        <p>Although a hardwood purchase ban was passed in 1993, this law included just 42 of the hundreds of tropical wood species, excluding types currently used by MTA. The agency has also testified to the wood’s strength, durability and rot resistance on the subway system that carries millions of passengers a day. Replacing the entire system’s tracks would also incur high initial costs - another eligible reason for an exemption under the old law - though state senators <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2009/a10503?" target="blank">argued</a> these would be more than offset by long-term savings using sustainable materials, not to mention the environmental benefit.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://legiscan.com/NY/text/S08898/2023" target="blank">TREES Act</a>, a bill passed by both houses of the New York state legislature in 2023 and again last year, would have broadened the 1993 law to more species of trees and other deforestation-linked products like palm oil, beef and coffee. It would have made New York the first state to require companies that supply the government to ensure their products aren’t sourced from deforested areas or contribute to human rights abuses. </p>
        <p>But New York Gov. Kathy Hochul vetoed the bill both years - last year, over complaints about certification requirements for small businesses. For now, the city’s famous subway continues to roll atop the remains of tropical trees.</p>
