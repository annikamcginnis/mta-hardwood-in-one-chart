# In-One-Chart: MTA Purchases of Tropical Forest Hardwood for NYC Subway

In this repo, I code a chart in the R ggplot package showing the NYC Metropolitan Transit Authority's purchases of tropical forest hardwood between 2014 and December 2024. This includes minor cleaning and analysis of the data in Python using the Pandas library.

I publish the chart in a story format here: https://annikamcginnis.github.io/mta-hardwood-in-one-chart/
